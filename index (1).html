       <p><h1>Home Much Does a Smart Home Cost?</h1></p> 
        <P>On one hand, more and more smart home products being brought to market will continually put pressure on manufacturers, competition, and product prices. On the other hand, these incredible innovations are continually expanding what they are capable of and may be assessed price premiums.</p>
        <P>When considering smart home products, perform a <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.asp target="_blank" title="go to learn more"> cost-benefit</a> analysis to determine whether the price exceeds the convenience.
        </P>
        <P><MARK><ins>&#128508;Important:</ins>According to HomeAdvisor, it may cost up to $15,000 to fully automate a four-bedroom, three-bath home. Average total home automation costs is just under $800, though fully-connected luxury homes may run into the six figures.</P></MARK>
        <p>In general, a smart home can start by being very focused on a specific product or room. This strategy allows individuals to invest in smart technology for minimal capital. Consider the following options priced at less than $100 as of September 2022:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Nest Mini, the home audio and assistant device.</li>
            <li>Amazon Smart Plug, a method of automating appliances.</li>
            <li>Ring Smart Doorbell, a video-enabled camera for home security.</li>
            <li>Wyze Thermostat, a digital, wireless, programmable heating device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the other hand, larger smart home technologies (with more capabilities) often cost thousands of dollars. For example, Vivant's Premium Plus Package for home security cost over $2,300 at writing.
            Alternatively, the LG 30.8 cubic foot Door-in-Door smart refrigerator could be had for a little over $7,000.</p>
